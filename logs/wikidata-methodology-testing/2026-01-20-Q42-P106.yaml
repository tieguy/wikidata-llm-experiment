  stop: "Are all the Wikidata occupations (playwright, screenwriter, novelist, children's writer, science fiction writer, comedian, writer, musician) accurate?"
  investigate: "Multiple sources confirm writer/author, screenwriter, humorist. IMDb and other sources confirm radio dramatist. Sources mention he played guitar for Pink Floyd."
  find_better: "Core occupations well-supported. Some edge cases: 'playwright' less clear (primarily radio/TV), 'children's writer' weak evidence."
  trace: "His published works serve as primary evidence for writer/novelist/screenwriter. Doctor Who scripts prove screenwriting. Radio Academy Hall of Fame confirms radio work."
